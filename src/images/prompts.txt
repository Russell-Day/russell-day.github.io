Create a realistic, high-detail medical AI research scene in a radiology reading room.
Show a clinician-scientist at a workstation with anonymized bladder-cancer records, structured extraction tables, and subtle model confidence visualizations.
Include monitors with clean UI overlays suggesting small-model LLM fine-tuning and clinical feature extraction.
Visual tone: professional, trustworthy, research-grade, no brand logos, no readable patient data.
Style: editorial photography + cinematic lighting, cool blue/teal palette, shallow depth of field.
Composition: wide horizontal crop (16:10), space for text overlays in top-left and bottom-right corners.
"""

gaudmire.png = """
Create a polished research-operations image for systematic review automation.
Depict a transition from stacks of research papers to an intelligent digital triage dashboard with inclusion/exclusion columns and progress metrics.
Convey speed and efficiency gains with visual cues like workflow arrows, sorted queues, and review checkpoints.
Visual tone: academic, rigorous, modern, no logos or copyrighted UI.
Style: high-end product visualization mixed with documentary realism, warm-neutral highlights with blue accents.
Composition: wide horizontal crop (16:10), clear focal area in center-left.

pop_health.png = """
Create a medical imaging research visual for breast cancer subtype-first classification.
Show pathology slide textures and AI attention maps/heatmaps on a multi-panel analytics display.
Include subtle cues of hierarchical prediction (subtype first, then benign vs malignant) without adding literal text labels.
Visual tone: scientific, precise, clinically grounded.
Style: clean biomedical visualization with realistic monitor reflections, magenta/cyan accents over a neutral dark lab environment.
Composition: wide horizontal crop (16:10), strong contrast and readable midground details.

blueprints.png = """
Create a nonprofit healthcare logistics technology scene for inventory automation.
Show organized medical supplies in a warehouse/packing environment with barcode labels, sorted bins, and a tablet dashboard for automated naming/pricing workflows.
Include subtle signals of measurable impact at scale (large inventory movement, efficient packing lines, global shipment context).
Visual tone: mission-driven, operational, human-centered, no logos.
Style: realistic documentary photography with polished commercial lighting, balanced warm/cool color grading.
Composition: wide horizontal crop (16:10), clean foreground objects and depth in background.
"""

clinical_multimodal_survival.png = """
Create a future-facing hospital AI research image combining multimodal data.
Blend anonymized imaging panels, longitudinal clinical timeline cards, and predictive survival modeling dashboards in one cohesive workstation scene.
Tone should communicate translational clinical AI, from research bench to bedside utility.
Style: premium medical technology editorial, cool palette with soft highlights, high realism.
Composition: wide horizontal crop (16:10), center focus with empty space for title text.
"""

research_lab_team_presentation.png = """
Create a conference-style research presentation scene with a young research team presenting clinical AI findings.
Show a poster session or podium environment with charts, imaging examples, and engaged attendees.
Avoid specific conference logos or trademarked branding.
Tone: high-impact, academic, professional, collaborative.
