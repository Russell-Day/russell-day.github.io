## [Website](https://russell-day.github.io/)
My personal website is a basic mobile first responsive design using Vite, React, and Tailwind css frameworks. Just a quick summer project that I did. 

## Basic Dependencies
gh-pages (hosting on github pages)

Tailwind css

Vite

React

React Router Dom

This personal website was built with inspiration off of a friends personal website [Aaron Huang](https://aahuang.com/)

## Local development

- Install deps: npm ci
- Start dev server: npm run dev
- Build: npm run build
- Preview production build: npm run preview

## Privacy notes

- Do not commit phone number or home address. The CV/Resume page embeds PDFs from `cv-current/`; ensure exported PDFs do not contain phone/address before pushing.
- Avoid committing LaTeX build artifacts (`*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.out`, `*.synctex.gz`, `*.fdb_latexmk`, `*.fls`).
